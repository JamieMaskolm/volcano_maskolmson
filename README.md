**How was it created?**

VOLCANO is a game that was created during my first semester at  University.<br>
We had to develop 2 polygon-like games in Python (Pygame)<br> in the Software Development module.<br>

My team and I only had a limited amount of time to develop the games. <br>
This almost meant that we couldn't finish the project before the deadline, <br>
but we were still able to exceed our professor's expectations: <br>
Not only did we create real animations (sprites) instead of floating pixels, <br>
but we were even able to compose our own soundtrack for the game...<br>
<br>

<br>

**Controls:**

&larr; = Left

&rarr; = Right

&uarr; = Up

&darr; = Down

SPACE = Jump

*We wish all those who try our game a lot of fun!*

*Feel free to write us comments or give feedback if something is not working well so we can fix it.*

*Many thanks to our friends and all the others who have helped us with this project!*
